                   GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 2, June 1991

 Copyright (C) 2024 smartynow
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                    Preamble

  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works. The licenses for most software
are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By
contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee
your freedom to share and change all versions of a programâ€”to make
sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free
Software Foundation, use the term "copyleft" to refer to the
general method of making a program free, and requiring all
modified and extended versions of the program to be free as well.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and
charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code
or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software and
use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do
these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the
rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
rights that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive
or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so
they know their rights.

  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two
steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this
License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or
modify it.

  For the developers' and authors' sake, the GPL ensures that
everyone else also has these rights. For example, if you distribute
copies of the program, you must pass on the same license. Thus, you
could not impose a more restrictive license on it.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents. We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively
control the use of the program by obtaining a patent on it. To this
end, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for
everyone's free use or not at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may
be distributed under the terms of this General Public License.
The "Program", below, refers to any such program or work, and a
"work based on the Program" means either the Program or any
derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work
containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with
modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter,
translation is included without limitation in the term
"modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".

  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are
not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the
Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on
the Program (independent of having been made by running it). Whether
that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of
any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of
this License along with the Program.

  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for
a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any
portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy
and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section
1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
   stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work based on the Program to be licensed
   as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of
   this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
   when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
   interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
   announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
   notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
   a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
   these conditions, and telling the user how to obtain a copy of
   this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive
   but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based
   on the Program is not required to do so.)

  These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms
of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the
following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
   source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
   1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software
   interchange, or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
   years, to give anyone who possesses a copy of the object code or
   executable form the source code for all the software in the
   Program, for a charge no more than your cost of physically
   transferring a copy, and that you will give the source code to
   anyone who requests it by any reasonable means. You may specify
   that your offer applies only to that specific version of the
   Program, and you may indicate your willingness to give source code
   for future versions if you do not promise to do so.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise
to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and
will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However,
parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this
License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties
remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore,
by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so,
and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or
modifying the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program or a work based on the
Program, the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject
to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do
not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you,
then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be
to refrain entirely from distribution.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an geographical distribution limitation excluding those
countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. See
<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to
it and "any later version", you have the option of following the
terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version
published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not
specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version
ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other
free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to
the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by
the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation;
we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by
the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of
our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software
generally.

                    NO WARRANTY

  11. Because the Program is licensed free of charge, there is no
warranty for the Program, to the extent permitted by applicable law.
Except when otherwise stated in writing the copyright holders and/or
other parties provide the Program "as is" without warranty of any
kind, either expressed or implied, including, but not limited to,
the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular
purpose. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the
Program is with you. Should the Program prove defective, you assume
the cost of all necessary servicing, repair or correction.

  12. In no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in
writing will any copyright holder, or any other party who may
modify and redistribute the Program as permitted above, be liable to
you for damages, including any general, special, incidental or
consequential damages arising out of the use or inability to use the
Program (including but not limited to loss of data or data being
rendered inaccurate or losses sustained by you or third parties or a
failure of the Program to operate with any other programs), even if
such holder or other party has been advised of the possibility of such
damages.
